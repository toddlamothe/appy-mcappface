# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v5.7.1`+ and NPM `3.6.0`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* Not currently stored in a github repo - obtain source code from author
* `npm install` to install all dependencies (this will run typings install as well)
* `npm start` to start the dev server
* Server will be running on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/)
